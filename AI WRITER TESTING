<p> AI's ARTICLE</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of sadness and grieve,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feeling of being all alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The feeling of not knowing what to do, The feeling of being lost and confused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feeling of being scared and anxious, The feeling of not being able to cope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the feelings that I have, The feelings that I am struggling to ignore.</p>
<p>MY INTEREST FOR THIS</p>
<p>my in put require for AI is to write a poem about sadness feeling and grieve. I hope AI can create a feeling of&nbsp;  Sadness is characterized by a low mood or feeling down, often in response to something that was disappointing or discouraging, or caused other negative feelings. Sadness can happen on its own, but is usually relieved by the passage of time, self-care activities, or doing something you enjoy to cheer yourself up. I hope AI can have some fact to prove how sadness is, because&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; You have 43 facial muscles expressing the whole spectrum of emotions. Emotions can last from less than a second to several minutes. Sad emotions tend to affect you for longer than the positive ones. Mood lasts much longer than an emotion.</p>
<p>MY FEEDBAVK FOR THIS POEM</p>
<p>I think this is not what the poem I expect. Firstly, it looks very bored, when I read it, it just repeat the same sructure and change a fews word in different sentences. so I think is did not express a emotions that touch audience heart. Secondly, it shows some example that we will do when we are saad, but the feeling is bad, i mean it just show some feeature of sad, but it do not have a final theme or idea and those emotions words look very saperate. AI did not use descriptive language or any other good method for write a poem, it just telling in a very normal way. overall, I believe that AI's writing will never better than human or always achieve the things audience expect, because AI do not have the creativity and own thought as same as huma. It just a code fobored writing.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;while AI systems may be able to assist with certain aspects of the writing process or generate content in specific contexts, it is unlikely that they will fully replace human authors in the near future &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
